        "#Q1 - Answer -*Multithreading in Python refers to the concurrent execution of multiple threads (smaller units of a program) within a single process. Each thread runs independently, allowing tasks to be performed simultaneously, which can improve the efficiency of programs that require tasks to be executed concurrently.However, Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits true parallelism in CPU-bound tasks because only one thread can execute Python bytecode at a time. Therefore, multithreading in Python is most effective for I/O-bound tasks (such as reading and writing to files, network requests, etc.) rather than CPU-bound tasks.\n",
